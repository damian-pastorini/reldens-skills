The idea behind this package is to provide a skills and experience systems so you can relate these to a target owner.
Note, though it is an opined implementation it provides a lot of flexibility and it could be implemented on any project.
The package base features can be used in both server or client side, but we additionally provide some server specific
functions like storage models, SQL scripts for installation, sender and receiver support for communication between
the server and the client.
