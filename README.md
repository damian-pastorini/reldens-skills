# Reldens - Skills

## About
The idea behind this package is to provide a comprehensive skills and experience system that can be attached to any target owner.
This opinionated yet flexible implementation includes class paths, leveling systems, skill trees, and experience management with full event-driven architecture.

The package offers both client and server-side functionality, including automatic level progression, skill validation, damage calculations, physical attacks, effects system, and complete database integration.
